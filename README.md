# FAQ Accordion

This app is like an FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) section you often see on websites. It shows a list of questions, and when you click on a question, the answer appears below it. Each question has a little button next to it. When you click on the button, it toggles to show or hide the answer. It's a handy way to find answers to common questions without cluttering up the page with too much information all at once.
